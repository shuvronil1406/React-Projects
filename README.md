## 📌 About This Repository

This repository documents my **React learning journey** through hands-on projects.  
Each project focuses on strengthening a specific concept such as:

- 🧠 React fundamentals  
- ⚛️ Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useCallback`)  
- 🎨 Component-based UI design  
- 🌐 Modern tooling (Vite, npm)  
- 🧩 Clean code & reusability  

The goal is **learning by building**, not just watching tutorials.
